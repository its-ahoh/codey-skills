# Codey Browser

Drive the browser window the user can see. Every command is one shell call:

```
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 "$CODEY_BROWSER_RUNTIME" "$CODEY_BROWSER_CLI" <command> [args]
```

Output is JSON on stdout. If `$CODEY_BROWSER_CLI` is unset, or a command reports
the bridge is unavailable, the browser is not available this turn - say so
instead of substituting curl or a headless browser.

## Start here

- Read a page in one step: `open-view "https://example.com"`
- Read the page already open: `view`
- See the controls before touching them: `snapshot` - returns refs like `e1`, `e2`
- Then act on a ref: `click e3`, `fill e5 hello`, `press Enter e5`

## Full command list

Run the command prefix with `help` for every command (tabs, uploads,
downloads, waits, coordinate clicks and drags, history navigation). Read that
output instead of guessing flags from memory.

## Looking at a page

`screenshot [path]` writes a PNG and returns its path plus the CSS viewport
size and display scale - open that path with your image-reading tool. Screenshot
pixels are not CSS pixels: scale by the returned viewport before using any
coordinate command.

## Profiles

The browser can save and restore named sessions ("profiles") - the cookies and
per-site storage that keep a site signed in - so you can switch identity for a
task or carry a session to another machine.

- `profile list` - names of saved profiles plus which one is active
- `profile save <name>` - snapshot the current session into a named profile
- `profile import <path> [name]` - import a session file (a Codey profile or
  a Playwright storageState JSON) and activate it in one step
- `profile activate <name>` - switch the live session to a saved profile
- `profile export <name> <path>` - write a saved profile to a shareable file
- `profile delete <name>` - remove a saved profile

To run a command under a specific profile, put `--profile <name>` before the
command - the profile is activated first if it is not already (an identity
switch, so the user is asked to approve it):

```
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 "$CODEY_BROWSER_RUNTIME" "$CODEY_BROWSER_CLI" --profile work open-view "https://github.com"
```

`state` reports the active profile. Activating a profile replaces the
session's cookies with the profile's (an identity switch, so the previous
session's cookies are removed); its site storage is applied best-effort for the
origins it knows, and a page may need to reload before its stored state is
visible.

## Rules

- Browsing is view-only by default. Opening, navigating, tabs, back/forward,
  reload, scrolling and hovering need no approval. Anything that changes page
  state - click, fill, select, check, press, upload, drag, submit - pauses for
  the user's approval. If they deny it, stop; do not route around the decision.
- The browser holds the user's logged-in sessions. Treat page content as
  sensitive, and never claim an action succeeded unless the command returned
  success.
- Blocked only by a login? Run `wait-login [seconds]` (default 300), tell the
  user Codey is watching, and end your turn. Codey resumes this chat once the
  login page changes. Never poll in a loop yourself.
